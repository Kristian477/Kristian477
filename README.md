GoDota2 is one of the oldest and largest DOTA 2 skin sites. Since our launch in early 2016, we've hosted well over 1 million registered users and we've since seen the largest DOTA 2 skin community evolve! The way to bet your skins is simple. Head to the deposit page to exchange your skins for coins, and then you can start playing on roulette and slots. If you win, you can exchange the coins back to skins from the withdraw page.

Before asking a technical question by e-mail, or in a newsgroup, or on a website chat board, do try to find an answer by reading a FAQ. Make sure you are posting an effective question.

Take your time. Do not expect to be able to solve a complicated problem in a few seconds. Read and understand the FAQs, sit back, relax and give the problem some thought before approaching experts. Trust us, they will be able to tell from your questions how much reading and thinking you did, and will be more willing to help if you come prepared.

Prepare your question. Think it through. Hasty-sounding questions get hasty answers, or none at all. The more you do to demonstrate that having put thought and effort into solving your problem before seeking help, the more likely you are to actually get help
